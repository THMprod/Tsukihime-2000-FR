ONScripter-Tools:

All tools are meant to be run from the command line.

nscdec.exe: nscdec nsc_file [out_file]
For converting a packaged script file (e.g. "nscript.dat") to a text script
("result.txt" by default)


nscmake.exe: nscmake [-o nsc_file] in_file(s)
For converting text script file(s) to a packaged script file
("nscript.dat" by default); using wildcard pattern "[0-9][0-9].txt" for
in_file(s) works well for merging a set of numbered scripts.


nsadec.exe: nsadec [-offset num] [-o out_dir] arc_file
For extracting files from an nsa archive file (e.g. "arc.nsa");
will place the files under directory out_dir, if provided.
'-offset' replaces the old '-ns2' and '-ns3' options (rarely needed).


sardec.exe: sardec [-o out_dir] arc_file
For extracting files from a sar archive file (e.g. "arc.sar");
will place the files under directory out_dir, if provided


nsamake.exe: nsamake arc_file [-e] -d in_dir
             nsamake arc_file [-e] in_file(s)
Creates an nsa archive as arc_file (e.g. "arc.nsa").
The usage formats work the same as with ns2make, except that when
the option -e is provided, it will attempt to compress BMP and WAV files
in the archive using NBZ encoding.
